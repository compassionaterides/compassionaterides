Goods - goods are the items that you are selling to consumers. These Terms and Conditions set out provisions around what goods are available for sale. For example, they explain that the purchase of goods described on your website is subject to availability and that descriptions are for illustrative purposes only personal information - terms setting out consumers' right to have their information treated fairly, and stating that they consent to certain communications from your business basis of sale - sets out how and when the contract of sale is formed between your business and a customer. This section explains at what point of the purchasing process an order is confirmed price and payment - these terms explain what payment is required and how this can be made delivery - provisions setting out expectations for when goods will be delivered and when exceptions may be made to these expected time frames. This section also discusses what happens if you do not deliver the goods on time (eg the consumer's right to a refund) risk and title - terms describing the point of the purchase process at which ownership of the goods is transferred to the consumer withdrawal - these terms explain the consumer's right to back out of the purchase at any point before a contract is formed cancellation - these terms explain the consumer's cancellation rights, including when and how a consumer can cancel a purchase and what happens if they do (eg the goods must be returned and the seller must provide a refund). They also explain when cancellation rights do not apply conformity - terms setting out a consumer's right for their goods to meet the terms implied under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (eg that they must be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose) guarantee - you may choose to offer a guarantee to consumers with their goods. This means that you provide a legal promise, usually asserting that the goods are of good quality and that, if they're found not to be so, the manufacturer (or seller) will provide repairs or replacements. Details of any guarantees you offer should be included with your goods when they're delivered successors and subcontractors - this section deals with what happens if the benefits of this contract (ie the rights and entitlements that it confers) are transferred (ie 'assigned') to another party. It explains that, if this happens, the party that transferred their benefits under the contract will remain responsible for their responsibilities under it circumstances beyond the control of either party - these clauses explain what happens if an unforeseen event outside of both the business' and customer's control occurs, which makes performance of the contract (eg delivering items or payment) impossible. They explain what each party may be liable for in this situation, and that such situations will not impact consumers' rights related to delivery and cancellation. For more information, read Force majeure privacy - this section sets out the data protection rights and responsibilities applicable under the contract. This includes providing links to the business' data protection policies excluding liability - this clause explains the limits to the business' liability (ie responsibility) if the consumer experiences loss due to a fault in the goods they're supplied with. This clause reduces the risk that the business is exposed to when contracting to supply goods and reduces the likelihood of the business having to pay damages (ie compensation) to a consumer if something goes wrong. This clause is written in a manner which is fair to the consumer, in compliance with the Consumer Rights Act 2015, so that it can be enforceable. For more information, read Limitation of liability clauses governing law and jurisdiction - this section explains which country's legal system must be used to resolve any disputes. This is necessary as the legal systems of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are different complaints - these clauses set out the business' procedures for customer complaints. This may help the business to avoid legal disputes, if it helps to resolve any issues before they reach the point of litigation codes of conduct - these are sets of principles that the business has committed to adhering to, for example, a set of moral and ethical standards model cancellation form - this short form, at the bottom of the document, sets out which information consumers should give you if they wish to exercise their cancellation rights. It provides a template for them to use to provide this information. The INFORM Consumers Act requires online marketplaces to “implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices.” That includes putting administrative, physical, and technical safeguards in place that are appropriate to the nature of the data and the purposes for which the data is used.</p>
